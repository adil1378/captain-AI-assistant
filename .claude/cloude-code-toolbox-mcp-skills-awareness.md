# Cloude Code ToolBox — MCP & Skills awareness

_Generated: 2026-08-11T14:36:25.966Z_

## How to use this report

- **Saved copy:** This file is **`.claude/cloude-code-toolbox-mcp-skills-awareness.md`** — refreshed whenever the toolbox runs an MCP & Skills scan (including on workspace open when auto-scan is enabled). It is meant for **Claude Code workspace context** together with `CLAUDE.md` (which gets a shorter replaceable summary when auto-merge is on).
- **MCP:** Lists **configured** servers from Claude Code config (`~/.claude.json` for user scope, `.mcp.json` for project scope). Use `/mcp` in the Claude Code panel to connect servers for your session.
- **Skills:** **On-disk** folders with `SKILL.md`. Claude Code does not auto-load them; attach `SKILL.md` or paths in chat when useful.
- **Task routing:** When the user’s request matches a server’s purpose (e.g. Confluence → Confluence/Atlassian MCP), prefer that **server id** from the tables below.

## MCP — workspace

Workspace `mcp.json` _(folder: captain)_

- **d:\captain\.mcp.json** — _File missing_

## Skills (local `SKILL.md` folders)

### Project-scoped

_None found (or no workspace open)._

### User-scoped

- **developing-with-streamlit** — `C:\Users\Adil\.claude\skills\developing-with-streamlit`
  - Use for ALL Streamlit tasks: creating, editing, debugging, beautifying, styling, theming, optimizing, or deploying Streamlit apps. Also custom components, st.components.v2, HTML/JS/CSS work. Discovers and loads version-m

## Suggested next steps

- **MCP:** Use this extension’s hub **MCP** tab, or `claude mcp list` in the terminal. In Claude Code, use `/mcp` to connect servers for the session.
- **Edit config:** Open `~/.claude.json` (user MCP) or `<workspace>/.mcp.json` (project MCP) via the extension commands.
- **Refresh this report:** run **Intelligence — scan MCP & Skills awareness** again after changing MCP config or adding skills.
